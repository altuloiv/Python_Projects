PYTHON PROJECTS
This is the README File going over the projects I have done in my Python Course.

Projects:
- Bank App
- File Transfer App
- PhoneBook
- HTML File Creator

Bank App
    The Bank app is a Django Project that I worked on that creates a simple app that allows the user to
    create a user account with an initial balance, then add transactions to the account. Functions will
    be pulled from a database and posted to it as well through commands as well. 

File Transfer App
   The File Transfer App was an app that would allow the user to automatically copy files in a directory every
   24 hours into a seperate folder, once the files where checked. This used some TKinter in the project.

PhoneBook
    This project functions as a phone book for a user. It saves a contact's name, phone number, and email addres
    in a database and allows the user to update and dlete previously stored entries.

HTML File Creator
    This project created a GUI where the user can enter any text they would like, and when submitted, the app
    would write the information into a HTML element, then run the HTML file onto the web browser.
