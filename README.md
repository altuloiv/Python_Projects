# Python_Projects
This is the README File going over the projects I have done in my Python Course.

Projects:
- Bank App
- File Transfer App
- PhoneBook
- HTML File Creator

Bank App:
The Bank app is a Django Project that I worked on that creates a simple app that allows the user to create a user account with an initial balance, then add transactions to the account. Functions will be pulled from a database and posted to it as well through commands as well. 

File Transfer App:
The File Transfer App was an app that would allow the user to automatically copy files in a directory every 24 hours into a seperate folder, once the files where checked. This used some TKinter in the project.

PhoneBook:
This project functions as a phone book for a user. It saves a contact's name, phone number, and email addres in a database and allows the user to update and dlete previously stored entries.

HTML File Creator:
This project created a GUI where the user can enter any text they would like, and when submitted, the app would write the information into a HTML element, then run the HTML file onto the web browser.
